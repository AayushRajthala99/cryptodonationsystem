# Crypto Donation System

## :star2: About the Project
<p>Crypto – Donation System is a decentralized application where users can securely donate Cryptocurrency to each other with high level of transparency. This Dapp aims to provide an interface for anyone (with some ether at their disposal) to donate crypto-fund. Users can donate cryptocurrency using the recipient's Wallet ID. This Dapp leverages the security and trustlessness of the best-in-class Ethereum platform and highly secure wallet Metamask.

## :clipboard: General Desription

### :bust_in_silhouette: Users

The product is designed for the primary users who are fairly knowledgeable about block chain technology, cryptocurrencies & crypto-transactions.

### :thinking: Assumption & User Dependencies

We assume that the user wants to perform crypto-donation via highly secure and easy-to-use application based on blockchain technology. The system is dependent upon the user and their crypto wallet (portfolio) as the transaction requires the user’s crypto wallet to hold some amount of cryptocurrency. The system is also dependent upon Smart Contracts based on Solidity.
